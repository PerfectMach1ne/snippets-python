# Python has FOUR INBUILT DATA STRUCTURES:
# List
# Dictionary
# Tuple
# Set

# List is a mutable data structure i.e items can be added to list later after the list creation. Itâ€™s like you are going
# to shop at the local market and made a list of some items and later on you can add more and more items to the list.
# (so basically it's like an array; STILL DIFFERENT though)
# use append() to add data to list

math = [] # creates a math list

math.append(9)
math.append(10)
math.append(2.1)

print(math)
